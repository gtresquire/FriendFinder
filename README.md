# FriendFinder - Node.js application using Express

## Overview:

## FriendFinder is a compatibility-based application that takes in results from a survey, and compares the user's answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Step 1: User presses start button to begin the survey.

## Step 3:  User submits the survey to find their match.  If the survey is incomplete a message appears telling the user to provide responses to all of the questions.
