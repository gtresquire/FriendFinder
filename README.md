# Friend Finder - Node.js application using Express and MySql

## Overview

## Friend Finder is a compatibility-based application that takes in results from a survey, and compares the user's answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Step 1: Press the start button to begin the survey.
